                    Leonor Valenzuela, a tall girl from Pagsanjan. Rizal send her love notes written in invisible
                    ink, that could only be deciphered over the warmth of the lamp or candle. He visited her on the
                    eve of his departure to Spain and bade her a last goodbye.</p>

                <p>Leonor Rivera, his sweetheart for 11 years played the greatest influence in keeping him from falling
                    in love with other women during his travel. Unfortunately, Leonor’s mother disapproved of her
                    daughter’s relationship with Rizal, who was then a known filibustero. She hid from Leonor all
                    letters sent to her sweetheart. Leonor believing that Rizal had already forgotten her, sadly
                    consented her to marry the Englishman Henry Kipping, her mother’s choice.</p>

                    dedicated to her A la Senorita C.O. y R., which became one of his best poems. The Ortiga's residence
                    in Madrid was frequented by Rizal and his compatriots. He probably fell in love with her and
                    Consuelo apparently asked him for romantic verses. He suddenly backed out before the relationship
                    turned into a serious romance, because he wanted to remain loyal to Leonor Rivera and he did not
                    want to destroy hid friendship with Eduardo de Lete who was madly in love with Consuelo.</p>

                    She also helped Rizal improve his knowledge of Japanese language. If Rizal was a man without a
                    patriotic mission, he would have married this lovely and intelligent woman and lived a stable and
                    happy life with her in Japan because Spanish legation there offered him a lucrative job.</p>

                <p>While Rizal was in London annotating the Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, he boarded in the house of
                    the Beckett family, within walking distance of the British Museum. Gertrude, a blue-eyed and buxom
                    girl was the oldest of the three Beckett daughters. She fell in love with Rizal. Tottie helped him
                    in his painting and sculpture. But Rizal suddenly left London for Paris to avoid Gertrude, who was
                    seriously in love with him. Before leaving London, he was able to finish the group carving of the
                    Beckett sisters. He gave the group carving to Gertrude as a sign of their brief relationship.</p>

                <p class="bold">Nellie Boustead</p>
                <p>Rizal having lost Leonor Rivera, entertained the thought of courting other ladies. While a guest of
                    the Boustead family at their residence in the resort city of Biarritz, he had befriended the two
                    pretty daughters of his host, Eduardo Boustead. Rizal used to fence with the sisters at the studio
                    of Juan Luna. Antonio Luna, Juan’s brother and also a frequent visitor of the Bousteads, courted
                    Nellie but she was deeply infatuated with Rizal. In a party held by Filipinos in Madrid, a drunken
                    Antonio Luna uttered unsavory remarks against Nellie Boustead. This prompted Rizal to challenge Luna
                    into a duel. Fortunately, Luna apologized to Rizal, thus averting tragedy for the compatriots.

                <p>In 1890, Rizal moved to Brussels because of the high cost of living in Paris. In Brussels, he lived
                    in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters. In time, they fell deeply in love with each other.
                    Suzanne cried when Rizal left Brussels and wrote him when he was in Madrid.</p>

                <p class="bold">Josephine Bracken</p>
                <p>In the last days of February 1895, while still in Dapitan, Rizal met an 18-year old petite Irish
                    girl, with bold blue eyes, brown hair and a happy disposition. She was Josephine Bracken, the
                    adopted daughter of George Taufer from Hong Kong, who came to Dapitan to seek Rizal for eye
                    treatment. Rizal was physically attracted to her. His loneliness and boredom must have taken the
                    measure of him and what could be a better diversion that to fall in love again. But the Rizal
                    sisters suspected Josephine as an agent of the friars and they considered her as a threat to Rizal’s
                    security. <br><br>

                    Rizal asked Josephine to marry him, but she was not yet ready to make a decision due to her
                    responsibility to the blind Taufer. Since Taufer’s blindness was untreatable, he left for Hon Kong
                    on March 1895. Josephine stayed with Rizal’s family in Manila. Upon her return to Dapitan, Rizal
                    tried to arrange with Father Antonio Obach for their marriage. However, the priest wanted a
                    retraction as a precondition before marrying them. Rizal upon the advice of his family and friends
                    and with Josephine’s consent took her as his wife even without the Church blessings. Josephine later
                    give birth prematurely to a stillborn baby, a result of some incidence, which might have shocked or
                    frightened her.
