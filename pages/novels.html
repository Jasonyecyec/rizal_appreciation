        <p class="novel-text">
            Spain, to Rizal, was a venue for realizing his dreams. He finished his studies in Madrid
            and this to him was
            the realization of the bigger part of his ambition. His vision broadened while he was in Spain to the point
            of awakening in him an understanding of human nature, sparking in him the realization that his people needed
            him. It must have been this sentiment that prompted him to pursue, during the re-organizational meeting of
            the Circulo-Hispano-Filipino, to be one of its activities, the publication of a book to which all the
            members would contribute papers on the various aspects and conditions of Philippines life. <br> <br>

            "My proposal on the book," he wrote on January 2, 1884, "was unanimously approved. But afterwards
            difficulties and objections were raised which seemed to me rather odd, and a number of gentlemen stood up
            and refused to discuss the matter any further. In view of this I decided not to press it any longer, feeling
            that it was impossible to count on general support..." <br><br>

            "Fortunately," writes one of Rizal’s biographers, the anthology, if we may call it that, was never written.
            Instead, the next year, Pedro Paterno published his Ninay, a novel sub-titled Costumbres filipinas
            (Philippines Customs), thus partly fulfilling the original purpose of Rizal’s plan. He himself (Rizal), as
            we have seen, had ‘put aside his pen’ in deference to the wishes of his parents. <br><br>

            But the idea of writing a novel himself must have grown on him. It would be no poem to forgotten after a
            year, no essay in a review of scant circulation, no speech that passed in the night, but a long and serious
            work on which he might labor, exercising his mind and hand, without troubling his mother’s sleep. He would
            call it Noli Me Tangere; the Latin echo of the Spoliarium is not without significance. He seems to have told
            no one in his family about his grand design; it is not mentioned in his correspondence until the book is
            well-nigh completed. But the other expatriates knew what he was doing; later, when Pastells was blaming the
            Noli on the influence of German Protestants, he would call his compatriots to witness that he had written
            half of the novel in Madrid a fourth part in Paris, and only the remainder in Germany. <br><br>

            "From the first," writes Leon Ma. Guerrero, Rizal was haunted by the fear that his novel would never find
            its way into print, that it would remain unread. He had little enough money for his own needs, let alone the
            cost of the Noli’s publication… Characteristically, Rizal would not hear of asking his friends for help. He
            did not want to compromise them. <br><br>

            Viola insisted on lending him the money (P300 for 2,000 copies); Rizal at first demurred… Finally Rizal gave
            in and the novel went to press. The proofs were delivered daily, and one day the messenger, according to
            Viola, took it upon himself to warn the author that if he ever returned to the Philippines he would lose his
            head. Rizal was too enthralled by seeing his work in print to do more than smile. <br><br>

            The printing apparently took considerably less time than the original estimate of five months for Viola did
            not arrive in Berlin until December and by the 21st March 1887, Rizal was already sending Blumentritt a copy
            of "my first book." <br><br>

            Rizal, himself, describing the nature of the Noli Me Tangere to his friend Blumentritt, wrote, "The Novel is
            the first impartial and bold account of the life of the tagalogs. The Filipinos will find in it the history
            of the last ten years…" <br><br>

            Criticism and attacks against the Noli and its author came from all quarters. An anonymous letter signed "A
            Friar" and sent to Rizal, dated February 15, 1888, says in part: "How ungrateful you are… If you, or for
            that matter all your men, think you have a grievance, then challenge us and we shall pick up the gauntlet,
            for we are not cowards like you, which is not to say that a hidden hand will not put an end to your life."
            <br><br>

            A special committee of the faculty of the University of Santo Tomas, at the request of the Archbishop Pedro
            Payo, found and condemned the novel as heretical, impious, and scandalous in its religious aspect, and
            unpatriotic, subversive of public order and harmful to the Spanish government and its administration of
            theses islands in its political aspect. <br> <br>

            On December 28, 1887, Fray Salvador Font, the cura of Tondo and chairman of the Permanent Commission of
            Censorship composed of laymen and ordered that the circulation of this pernicious book" be absolutely
            prohibited. <br><br>

            Not content, Font caused the circulation of copies of the prohibition, an act which brought an effect
            contrary to what he desired. Instead of what he expected, the negative publicity awakened more the curiosity
            of the people who managed to get copies of the book. <br><br>

            Assisting Father Font in his aim to discredit the Noli was an Augustinian friar by the name of Jose
            Rodriguez. In a pamphlet entitled Caiingat Cayo (Beware). Fr. Rodriguez warned the people that in reading
            the book they "commit mortal sin," considering that it was full of heresy. <br><br>

            As far as Madrid, there was furor over the Noli, as evidenced by an article which bitterly criticized the
            novel published in a Madrid newspaper in January, 1890, and written by one Vicente Barrantes. In like
            manner, a member of the Senate in the Spanish Cortes assailed the novel as "anti-Catholic, Protestant,
            socialistic." <br><br>

            It is well to note that not detractors alone visibly reacted to the effects of the Noli. For if there were
            bitter critics, another group composed of staunch defenders found every reason to justify its publication
            and circulation to the greatest number of Filipinos. For instance, Marcelo H. Del Pilar, cleverly writing
            under an assumed name Dolores Manapat, successfully circulated a publication that negated the effect of
            Father Rodriguez’ Caiingat Cayo, Del Pilar’s piece was entitled Caiigat Cayo (Be Slippery as an Eel).
            Deceiving similar in format to Rodriguez’ Caiingat Cayo, the people were readily "misled" into getting not a
            copy o Rodriguez’ piece but Del Pillar’s. <br><br>

            The Noli Me Tangere found another staunch defender in the person of a Catholic theologian of the Manila
            Cathedral, in Father Vicente Garcia. Under the pen-name Justo Desiderio Magalang. Father Garcia wrote a very
            scholarly defense of the Noli, claiming among other things that Rizal cannot be an ignorant man, being the
            product of Spanish officials and corrupt friars; he himself who had warned the people of committing mortal
            sin if they read the novel had therefore committed such sin for he has read the novel. <br><br>

            Consequently, realizing how much the Noli had awakened his countrymen, to the point of defending his novel,
            Rizal said: "Now I die content." <br><br>

            Fittingly, Rizal found it a timely and effective gesture to dedicate his novel to the country of his people
            whose experiences and sufferings he wrote about, sufferings which he brought to light in an effort to awaken
            his countrymen to the truths that had long remained unspoken, although not totally unheard of.

            whose experiences and sufferings he wrote about, sufferings which he brought to light in an effort to awaken
            his countrymen to the truths that had long remained unspoken, although not totally unheard of.`],

            elFili: ["El Filibusterismo", `The word "filibustero" wrote Rizal to his friend, Ferdinand Blumentritt, is very little known in the
            Philippines. The masses do not know it yet.<br> <br>

            Jose Alejandro, one of the new Filipinos who had been quite intimate with Rizal, said, "in writing the Noli
            Rizal signed his own death warrant." Subsequent events, after the fate of the Noli was sealed by the Spanish
            authorities, prompted Rizal to write the continuation of his first novel. He confessed, however, that
            regretted very much having killed Elias instead of Ibarra, reasoning that when he published the Noli his
            health was very much broken, and was very unsure of being able to write the continuation and speak of a
            revolution. <br><br>

            Explaining to Marcelo H. del Pilar his inability to contribute articles to the La Solidaridad, Rizal said
            that he was haunted by certain sad presentiments, and that he had been dreaming almost every night of dead
            relatives and friends a few days before his 29th birthday, that is why he wanted to finish the second part
            of the Noli at all costs.<br><br>

            Consequently, as expected of a determined character, Rizal apparently went in writing, for to his friend,
            Blumentritt, he wrote on March 29, 1891: "I have finished my book. Ah! I’ve not written it with any idea of
            vengeance against my enemies, but only for the good of those who suffer and for the rights of Tagalog
            humanity, although brown and not good-looking."<br><br>

            To a Filipino friend in Hong Kong, Jose Basa, Rizal likewise eagerly announced the completion of his second
            novel. Having moved to Ghent to have the book published at cheaper cost, Rizal once more wrote his friend,
            Basa, in Hongkong on July 9, 1891: "I am not sailing at once, because I am now printing the second part of
            the Noli here, as you may see from the enclosed pages. I prefer to publish it in some other way before
            leaving Europe, for it seemed to me a pity not to do so. For the past three months I have not received a
            single centavo, so I have pawned all that I have in order to publish this book. I will continue publishing
            it as long as I can; and when there is nothing to pawn I will stop and return to be at your side." <br><br>

            Inevitably, Rizal’s next letter to Basa contained the tragic news of the suspension of the printing of the
            sequel to his first novel due to lack of funds, forcing him to stop and leave the book half-way. "It is a
            pity," he wrote Basa, "because it seems to me that this second part is more important than the first, and if
            I do not finish it here, it will never be finished."<br><br>

            Fortunately, Rizal was not to remain in despair for long. A compatriot, Valentin Ventura, learned of Rizal’s
            predicament. He offered him financial assistance. Even then Rizal’s was forced to shorten the novel quite
            drastically, leaving only thirty-eight chapters compared to the sixty-four chapters of the first novel.
            <br><br>

            Rizal moved to Ghent, and writes Jose Alejandro. The sequel to Rizal’s Noli came off the press by the middle
            of September, 1891.On the 18th he sent Basa two copies, and Valentin Ventura the original manuscript and an
            autographed printed copy. <br><br>

            Inspired by what the word filibustero connoted in relation to the circumstances obtaining in his time, and
            his spirits dampened by the tragic execution of the three martyred priests, Rizal aptly titled the second
            part of the Noli Me Tangere, El Filibusterismo. In veneration of the three priests, he dedicated the book to
            them. <br><br>

            "To the memory of the priests, Don Mariano Gomez (85 years old), Don Jose Burgos (30 years old), and Don
            Jacinto Zamora (35 years old). Executed in the Bagumbayan Field on the 28th of February, 1872." <br> <br>

            "The church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime that has been imputed to you; the
            Government, by surrounding your trials with mystery and shadows causes the belief that there was some error,
            committed in fatal moments; and all the Philippines, by worshipping your memory and calling you martyrs, in
            no sense recognizes your culpability. In so far, therefore, as your complicity in the Cavite Mutiny is not
            clearly proved, as you may or may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not cherished sentiments for
            justice and for liberty, I have the right to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil which I
            undertake to combat. And while we await expectantly upon Spain some day to restore your good name and cease
            to be answerable for your death, let these pages serve as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over one who
            without clear proofs attacks your memory stains his hands in your blood." <br><br>

            Rizal’s memory seemed to have failed him, though, for Father Gomez was then 73 not 85, Father Burgos 35 not
            30 Father Zamora 37 not 35; and the date of execution 17th not 28th. <br><br>

            The FOREWORD of the Fili was addressed to his beloved countrymen, thus: <br><br>
